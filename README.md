# Code Portfolio

This repository is created to store the Code Portfolio created in Python and R and more items will be added over time.


Description:

1. Data Cleaning & Visualization (Python):

This is a demonstration of transforming real life datasets, cleaning and combining them, and visualizing with different chart types. It is a high-level comparison of the Information and Communications industry in HK and Japan.


2. Interactive Visualization (Python):

This is an interactive Python visualization demo. Color gradient of the bars would change according to the y-values that you pick. It is useful for decision makers to immediately visualize estimated impacts of different actions.


3. Machine Learning (R):

This machine learning demo revolves around a larger dataset of meter readings monitoring human exercise. It involves data transformation, principal component analysis and fitting of Multinomial Log-Linear Model and Random Forest.


4. HSI Analysis (R):

This is a time series analysis of HSI (Hang Seng Index) with autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. It also has some demonstrations with the R plotting package, ggplot2.
